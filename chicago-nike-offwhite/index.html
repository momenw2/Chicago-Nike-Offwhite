                    The Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG was one of the most highly anticipated footwear
                    collaborations of 2017. It marked the first time Virgil Abloh, founder of the Milan-based fashion
                    label
                    and Jordan Brand had teamed up. Nicknamed "The 10" edition, this pair comes in the original
                    Chicago-themed white, black and varsity red colorway. Featuring a white, red and black-based
                    deconstructed leather upper with a Swooshless medial side branded with "Off-White for Nike Air
                    Jordan 1,
                    Beaverton, Oregon, USA © 1985." Other details include: floppy ankle collars with hidden "85" written
                    on
                    the inside, an oversized off-centered Swoosh on the lateral sides, "Air" written on the midsole and
                    the
                    word "Shoelaces" on the laces with no branding on the tongue. Their release date is set for 2017
                    where
                    they retailed for $190 in men's sizes only. As if the hype wasn't enough, the limited availability
                    made
                    these Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG's highly sought after, way before their official
                    release.
